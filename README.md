# Academic Information System Security
This project focuses on securing an Academic Information System (AIS) database by implementing robust database security measures. Key security features include data encryption, access control, data masking, and auditing. The project aims to safeguard sensitive student and lecturer information, ensuring only authorized access and protecting data integrity.

## Key Components
- Data Protection: Encrypts sensitive data using Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), dynamic data masking, and hashing.
- Permission Management: Employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Row-Level Security (RLS) to restrict data access based on user roles.
- Auditing: Tracks database activities, providing logs for all major actions for accountability and security compliance.

This setup enhances the resilience and security of the AIS, ensuring privacy and compliance with institutional standards.
